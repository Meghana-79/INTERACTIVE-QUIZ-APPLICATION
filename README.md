TASK-1
To build a quiz application using JavaScript, we will create a dynamic, polished app where users can answer multiple-choice questions and receive instant feedback. The app will use HTML and CSS for layout and styling, and vanilla JavaScript to manage logic like loading questions from an array, checking answers, updating scores, and dynamically switching to the next question without refreshing the page. Each question will display four options, and when a user selects an answer, immediate feedback ("Correct!" or "Wrong!") will appear along with a visual highlight. The app will also maintain and display the current score, with a final results page once all questions are completed. Additional features like animated transitions, a progress bar, and randomized question order can be included to enhance user engagement and create a smooth, responsive experience.
